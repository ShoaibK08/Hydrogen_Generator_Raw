            <p class="text-sm lg:text-base xl:text-lg line-height-[26px] font-normal scroll">
              Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFCs) represent one of the most established and widely used types of fuel
              cells, with a strong track record in industrial and stationary power generation applications. These fuel
              cells utilize phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) as the electrolyte, which plays a crucial role in facilitating the
              electrochemical reactions that convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, water, and heat. PAFCs
              operate at moderate temperatures, typically ranging from 150°C to 200°C, which allows for greater
              tolerance to impurities in the hydrogen fuel, making them a reliable and durable choice for various
              applications.
              <br>
              The overall chemical reaction in a PAFC is:
              <br>
              <span id="dots"></span>
              <span id="more" style="display: none">
                <span style="font-weight: bold; ">
                  2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O + electricity + heat

                </span>
                </br>
                At the anode:
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; ">
                  H<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup>

                </span>
                </br>
                At the cathode:
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; ">
                  O<sub>2</sub> + 4H<sup>+</sup> + 4e<sup>-</sup> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O

                </span>
                <br></br>
                The core function of a PAFC involves the electrochemical reaction that occurs at the anode and cathode.
                At the anode, hydrogen molecules are split into protons and electrons. The protons move through the
                electrolyte, while the electrons flow through an external circuit, generating electricity. At the
                cathode, oxygen from the air combines with the protons and electrons to form water as the byproduct.
                This process is both efficient and environmentally friendly, as it produces zero harmful emissions—only
                water and heat are generated as byproducts, making PAFCs a clean energy technology.
                <br></br>
                One of the key advantages of PAFCs is their ability to operate at moderate temperatures compared to
                other fuel cell technologies, such as Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), which operate at much higher
                temperatures. This moderate operating temperature of 150°C to 200°C provides a balanced combination of
                high performance and manageable thermal requirements. Additionally, the liquid nature of the phosphoric
                acid electrolyte allows for better heat management and contributes to the stability of the fuel cell
                system, ensuring a longer lifespan and reducing the need for complex cooling systems.
                <br></br>
                PAFCs also exhibit excellent tolerance to impurities in the hydrogen fuel, which is another notable
                advantage over other types of fuel cells, such as Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). While
                PEM fuel cells require high-purity hydrogen for optimal performance, PAFCs can operate with hydrogen
                that contains small amounts of carbon monoxide, a common impurity in hydrogen gas derived from natural
                gas. This characteristic makes PAFCs more versatile and less dependent on high-purity hydrogen supply,
                which is often expensive and difficult to maintain in many regions. As a result, PAFCs are a suitable
                option for applications where the availability of ultra-pure hydrogen may be limited, such as industrial
                plants or combined heat and power (CHP) systems that rely on reforming hydrogen from natural gas.
                <br></br>
                The durability of PAFCs is another major benefit. These fuel cells are capable of withstanding long
                operational lifetimes, often exceeding 40,000 hours of continuous operation in many cases. This makes
                them well-suited for stationary power generation and CHP applications, where a reliable and long-lasting
                energy source is essential. PAFCs have already been deployed in a variety of large-scale power plants,
                where they provide continuous, stable electricity generation. They are also used in backup power systems
                for critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and data centers, where uninterrupted power supply is
                crucial. The ability of PAFCs to deliver both electricity and heat through CHP systems further enhances
                their value, as they can increase overall energy efficiency by utilizing the waste heat for space
                heating or industrial processes.
                <br></br>
                However, despite their many advantages, PAFCs do have some limitations. One of the most significant
                drawbacks is their lower power density compared to other fuel cell technologies, such as PEMFCs or Solid
                Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs). This means that PAFCs require larger physical volumes to generate the same
                amount of power as other fuel cell types. For instance, PEMFCs, which operate at lower temperatures
                (around 50–100°C), tend to be more compact and can provide higher power density in a smaller space. This
                difference in power density can make PAFCs less suitable for applications where space is limited, such
                as in transportation or portable devices. The larger size requirement also contributes to higher
                installation and maintenance costs in certain applications, especially in sectors where space efficiency
                is a premium.
                <br></br>
                Another challenge associated with PAFCs is the cost of the platinum catalysts used in the electrodes.
                Platinum, being a rare and expensive metal, is often used in fuel cells to promote the electrochemical
                reactions that generate electricity. Although PAFCs require less platinum than PEM fuel cells, the cost
                of platinum remains a significant factor in the overall cost of the system. Efforts are underway to
                reduce the reliance on platinum by exploring alternative catalysts or reducing the amount of platinum
                required. Additionally, the cost of phosphoric acid itself and other materials used in the construction
                of PAFCs can contribute to their high initial cost, making them less competitive compared to other
                energy technologies in certain markets.
                <br></br>
                Despite these challenges, PAFCs remain a valuable and promising technology in the clean energy
                landscape. Their ability to provide high-efficiency electricity generation, their relatively low
                operating temperatures, and their durability make them well-suited for stationary and industrial
                applications. In particular, PAFCs are a key component of the hydrogen economy, playing a crucial role
                in large-scale power plants, backup power systems, and CHP applications. As the world moves toward a
                cleaner, more sustainable energy future, the importance of PAFCs as a reliable and efficient source of
                power cannot be overstated.
                <br></br>
                To further increase the adoption and deployment of PAFCs, ongoing research and development efforts are
                focused on improving their performance, reducing costs, and expanding their range of applications. One
                area of focus is improving the performance of the phosphoric acid electrolyte itself. Researchers are
                exploring ways to enhance the conductivity of the electrolyte to improve the overall efficiency of the
                fuel cell. Additionally, advancements in catalyst development aim to reduce the reliance on platinum and
                other precious metals, making the technology more cost-competitive. New materials and manufacturing
                techniques are also being explored to reduce the size and weight of PAFCs, addressing some of the space
                and scalability challenges they face.
                <br></br>
                Moreover, PAFCs are poised to play a key role in the integration of renewable energy sources, such as
                solar and wind power, into the broader energy grid. As the demand for clean, low-carbon energy
                increases, PAFCs can provide a flexible and reliable means of generating electricity while also
                supporting energy storage and backup power capabilities. The ability of PAFCs to operate efficiently
                with a variety of fuels, including hydrogen produced from renewable sources, further strengthens their
                position as a cornerstone of the hydrogen economy.
                <br></br>
                In conclusion, Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFCs) are a mature and reliable fuel cell technology with
                significant potential for clean, efficient power generation. While they face challenges such as lower
                power density and high catalyst costs, their advantages—particularly in terms of reliability,
                durability, and tolerance to fuel impurities—make them a valuable technology for stationary power and
                combined heat and power (CHP) applications. As research continues to improve their performance and
                reduce costs, PAFCs will likely continue to play a critical role in the transition to a sustainable and
                low-carbon energy future. Their ability to integrate with renewable energy systems and support
                large-scale industrial applications positions them as an essential technology in the global effort to
                reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve energy security.
