              Grey hydrogen is primarily produced through a well-established industrial process known as steam methane
              reforming (SMR). This method involves reacting natural gas, which is predominantly methane (CH₄), with
              steam (H₂O) at elevated temperatures (700–1,000°C) and high pressure in the presence of a nickel-based
              catalyst. The initial reaction results in the formation of hydrogen (H₂), carbon monoxide (CO), and a
              smaller amount of carbon dioxide (CO₂). Subsequently, the carbon monoxide reacts further with steam in a
              secondary reaction, called the water-gas shift reaction, to produce additional hydrogen and carbon
              dioxide. The overall process can be summarized by the following chemical equations:

                <strong>1 .The reforming reaction:</strong> In this step, methane (CH₄) reacts with steam (H₂O) to

                carbon monoxide
                (CO) and hydrogen gas (H₂).

                The combined output is a significant yield of hydrogen gas, accompanied by substantial emissions of
                carbon dioxide, making SMR a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions.
                <br></br>
                Despite its environmental drawbacks, grey hydrogen remains the dominant method of hydrogen production
                today, accounting for the majority of the world's hydrogen supply. This widespread reliance on grey
                hydrogen can be attributed to several factors, including the abundance and accessibility of natural gas,
                the relative simplicity of the SMR process, and the established infrastructure supporting its production
                and distribution. The cost of grey hydrogen production is generally lower compared to other types of
                hydrogen, such as blue or green hydrogen, primarily because it does not require additional carbon
                capture and storage (CCS) technologies or renewable energy inputs.
                <br></br>

                However, the environmental implications of grey hydrogen are significant. Each ton of hydrogen produced
                through SMR releases approximately 9–12 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, depending on the
                efficiency of the process and the quality of the natural gas feedstock. These emissions contribute
                substantially to climate change and air pollution, highlighting the urgent need to transition to cleaner
                hydrogen production methods. The carbon footprint of grey hydrogen underscores the importance of
                addressing its environmental impact, particularly as global energy systems strive to achieve carbon
                neutrality.
                <br></br>
                One of the challenges in mitigating the environmental impact of grey hydrogen lies in the economics of
                cleaner alternatives. Blue hydrogen, which also relies on SMR but incorporates CCS technologies to
                capture and store the carbon dioxide produced, offers a more sustainable option. However, the added cost
                of CCS infrastructure makes blue hydrogen less competitive compared to grey hydrogen in the absence of
                stringent carbon pricing or regulatory frameworks. Similarly, green hydrogen, produced via electrolysis
                of water using renewable energy, represents the cleanest form of hydrogen but remains significantly more
                expensive due to the high costs of renewable energy and electrolyzer technology.
                <br></br>
                The reliance on grey hydrogen is particularly pronounced in industries that require large volumes of
                hydrogen, such as oil refining, ammonia production for fertilizers, and chemical manufacturing. In these
                sectors, the transition to cleaner hydrogen alternatives is often hindered by the need for significant
                investment in new technologies and infrastructure. Retrofitting existing facilities to incorporate CCS
                for blue hydrogen or transitioning to green hydrogen production would require substantial financial
                resources and policy support.
                <br></br>
                Despite these challenges, there is growing recognition of the need to phase out grey hydrogen in favor
                of more sustainable alternatives. Governments and industries are increasingly implementing measures to
                reduce the carbon footprint of hydrogen production. For instance, carbon pricing mechanisms, subsidies
                for green hydrogen projects, and investments in CCS technologies are being introduced to incentivize the
                shift away from grey hydrogen. International collaborations and research initiatives are also playing a
                crucial role in driving innovation and cost reductions in cleaner hydrogen production methods.
                <br></br>
                The environmental impact of grey hydrogen production is not limited to carbon dioxide emissions. The
                extraction and transportation of natural gas, which serves as the primary feedstock for SMR, can result
                in methane leaks. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential many times greater
                than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Addressing these upstream emissions is critical to reducing
                the overall climate impact of grey hydrogen.
                <br></br>
                In the context of the global energy transition, the role of grey hydrogen is likely to diminish over
                time as cleaner alternatives become more economically viable and policy frameworks favor
                decarbonization. However, in the short to medium term, grey hydrogen is expected to continue playing a
                significant role in meeting the growing demand for hydrogen across various sectors. During this
                transitional period, efforts to improve the efficiency of SMR processes, minimize methane leaks, and
                integrate CCS technologies can help mitigate the environmental impact of grey hydrogen.
                <br></br>
                In conclusion, grey hydrogen production through steam methane reforming represents a critical component
                of the current hydrogen economy, providing a cost-effective and widely available source of hydrogen for
                industrial and energy applications. However, its significant carbon footprint poses substantial
                environmental challenges, underscoring the need for a transition to cleaner hydrogen production methods.
                As technological advancements and policy measures drive progress in blue and green hydrogen, the
                reliance on grey hydrogen is expected to decrease, paving the way for a more sustainable and low-carbon
                energy future. </span>
